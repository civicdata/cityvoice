[Civic Data Alliance](http://www.civicdataalliance.org/) of Louisville, Kentucky created a deployment of CityVoice during CodeAcross on February 2016.

This code is deloyed at [CityVoice Dixie Highway](http://cityvoice.smartlouisville.com/), which is being used a public feedback system to improve safety, mobility and livability along a stretch of road in Louisville, KY. The project is called [The New Dixie Highway](https://louisvilleky.gov/government/new-dixie-highway).
